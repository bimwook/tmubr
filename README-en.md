# Trust Model under Bounded Rationality (TMUBR)

Title: Trust Model under Bounded Rationality — A Preliminary Exploration of Boundary-Based Cognitive Philosophy

I. Introduction: The Awakening of Dimensional Awareness
* Our worldview, behavioral patterns, and belief systems are grounded in the dimensions of cognition we possess.
* Just as a two-dimensional being cannot comprehend the three-dimensional world, human reason struggles to penetrate truth structures beyond our cognitive dimension.
* This essay outlines a cognition model built upon "boundary awareness," acknowledging both the limits of reason and the legitimacy of faith.

II. First Principle: Dimensional Awakening
* All cognitive activities occur within a specific dimensional framework.
* Human logic, emotion, and experience cycle within a closed system, while entities beyond it—such as God or the inner causal chains of others—are not fully analyzable through current cognition.
* Recognizing this limitation is the essence of "dimensional awakening."

III. Second Principle: Boundary Awareness
* Recognizing boundaries is not weakness, but a rational act.
* Boundary awareness helps us realize that not all problems can or need to be solved or judged.
* Practically, it directs us to focus on what is controllable and release what lies beyond control.

IV. Third Principle: The Unknowability of Others
* Other people’s behaviors are black-box systems—driven by causes, experiences, desires, fears, history, and preferences invisible from the outside.
* Therefore, "understanding others" is inherently limited, and "judging others" is often misleading.
* The proper posture is to respect others’ paths—even when their motivations remain incomprehensible.

V. The Unity of Faith and Reason
* Faith does not contradict reason; it is a structural act of trust once reason reaches its boundary.
* Just as axioms in mathematics cannot be proven but are accepted, faith operates as a system-level axiom—not as an emotional crutch.
* Boundary-based cognition recognizes faith as a dimensional shift, not as reason's opposition.

VI. Loneliness and Connection: The Situation of High-Dimensional Thinkers
* The clearer one’s dimensional awareness, the more one may experience loneliness due to "channel mismatch."
* Forming a cognitive community should not be about agreement on conclusions, but about shared awareness of dimensional differences.
* Among "dimensionally awakened" individuals, cognitive models can be shared—without enforcing uniformity of solutions.

VII. Applications
* In education: Cultivate students' boundary awareness and teach them to distinguish between understanding and judging.
* In organizational management: Reduce conflict by building respect mechanisms grounded in boundary recognition.
* In interpersonal relationships: Let go of control, enhance trust, and practice structural empathy.

VIII. Conclusion
* Only when we accept the limits of human reason do we begin to understand the meaning of "wisdom."
* True strength is not knowing everything, but revering what remains unknown.
